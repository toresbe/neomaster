Alternate software for the BeoMaster 5

This project serves two functions:

1. Improve my C++ (so, please don't judge the current code quality. Constructive criticism very welcome.)
2. Replace the excellent but limited software on the Beosound/Beomaster 5, particularily to re-enable Spotify

I will

1. ~~Reverse engineer the basics of controlling the Beosound 5 panel~~ Done :)
2. Create a basic user interface, controlled by the Beosound 5 panel
3. Create a simple example module to control my Philips Hue lights (to have some functionality that does not require reverse engineering the PC2)
4. Reverse engineer the PC2 in Audio Master mode
5. Play back media under panel control and output sound via the PC2.
6. Obtain IR data from the panel sensor/PC2 and control media with it

Future questions to be resolved include:

1. Can the B&O PC2 of all revisions be configured to operate as an Audio Master in a Beolink system?
2. How does the IR sensor on the Beosound 5 panel actually send its signal?
